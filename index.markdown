Hi, I am Camila Maia, a software developer. Welcome to my personal website.

I've been coding professionally since 2012, mostly with the Ruby and Python programming languages in the web development. Presently, I am developing mainly with Python. I've passed through different business fields during my career, like computing security, e-commerce, e-learning and finally and currently: logistics and supply chain. Regarding of academia, I have a bachelor degree in Computer Information Systems from the Federal University of Santa Catarina - Brazil.

Backend is my favorite one and my focus, I love to learn a bit from each area which I have direct contact to though. You can find me playing around with mobile development, data science or frontend during my free time. I believe in the value of t-shaped professionals.

Overall, I would say I am a software development, mathematics and football lover. Let's get in touch!
