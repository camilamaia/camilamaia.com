[ScanAPI](https://scanapi.dev): Automated Integration Testing and Live Documentation for your API!

![ScanAPI Header](/assets/scanapi-github-hero-dark.png)

A library for your API that provides:

- Automated Integration Testing
- Automated Live Documentation

Given an API specification, written in YAML/JSON format, ScanAPI hits the specified endpoints, runs the test cases, and generates a detailed report of this execution - that can be also used as the API documentation itself.

With almost none Python knowledge, the user can define endpoints to be hit, the expected behaviors for each response, and, as a result, receives a full real-time diagnostic of the API!
