# Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I am a Brazilian software developer that loves developing in Python and Ruby languages. I currently
work as a Backend Engineer at [Loadsmart](http://loadsmart.com/).

I am an open source advocated that does believe in the power of tech communities. People > Tech.

<!-- I've been coding professionally since 2012, mostly with the Ruby and Python programming languages
in the web development. Presently, I am developing mainly with Python. I've passed through different
 business fields during my career, like computing security, e-commerce, e-learning and finally and
 currently: logistics and supply chain.

Backend development is my favorite one and my focus, I love to learn a bit from each area which I
have direct contact to though. You can find me playing around with mobile development, data science
or frontend during my free time.

Overall, I would say I am a software development, mathematics and football lover. Let's get in
touch! -->
