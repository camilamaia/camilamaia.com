# Hi! I'm Camila Maia! ðŸ‘‹

I am a Brazilian software developer, currently working as Backend Engineer at [Loadsmart](http://loadsmart.com/).

I've been coding professionally since 2012, mostly with the Ruby and Python programming languages in the web development. Presently, I am developing mainly with Python. I've passed through different business fields during my career, like computing security, e-commerce, e-learning and finally and currently: logistics and supply chain.

Backend development is my favorite one and my focus, I love to learn a bit from each area which I have direct contact to though. You can find me playing around with mobile development, data science or frontend during my free time.

Overall, I would say I am a software development, mathematics and football lover. Let's get in touch!
