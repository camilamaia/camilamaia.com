# Hello, there! 👋
<hr class="dotted">

I am Camila Maia, a Brazilian software developer that loves to architect systems, create new
DevTools, and automate processes. Welcome to my personal website! I am a backend developer that
loves developing systems using Python or Ruby. 🐍 💎

I am truly passionate about sharing knowledge and connecting with people. I like to speak in tech conferences, organize events, to live code… These are some cool events that I helped to
organize/create:

- [Pyjamas](https://pyjamas.live) 2019/2020 (co-creator and organizer)
- [EuroPython 2020](https://ep2020.europython.eu)
- [Python Brasil 2020](https://2020.pythonbrasil.org.br)

For the last couple of years, I've been focusing increasingly on open source. Open source is where
I could find the perfect fit between people connection and coding in my day-to-day. As a result of
this effort, my GitHub profile was the first one to be accepted for the
[GitHub Sponsors program](https://github.com/sponsors) in Brazil, which made me incredibly happy.

Finally, I am an open source advocated that does believe in the power of tech communities.
